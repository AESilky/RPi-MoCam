# RPi-MoCam

Raspberry Pi Camera and Motion Detector w/Still&amp;Movie Buttons

This uses a Raspberry Pi (targeted to a Zero W) and a Pi Camera Module, plus a
motion detector and two momentary switches, to create a motion activated
monitoring camera.

The two switches allow manually taking a still photo or recording a video.
Holding down the photo button for an extended period shuts down the Pi.
